# Analysis of cluster features

This folder contains some processing and analysis scripts of the difference features of the cluster stars, and of the general dataset of meta-models.

- `analyze_concrete_features[-intra].py`: processes the exported dataset from the Java's meta-model comparison.

- `count_generics.py`: studies the presence of generic types in the dataset of meta-models

- `count_xmi_ids.py`: studies the presence of element identifiers (XMI IDs) in the meta-models of the dataset.
